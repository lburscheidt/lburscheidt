- 👋 Hi, I’m @lburscheidt
- 👀 I’m interested in web development and design. I'm passionate about making online apps accessible and intuitive to use for as many humans as possible as well as beautiful.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning front end development via The Odin Project. I'm also a bit of a tinkerer and have a bunch of tech wired up in my place... an old laptop running Ubuntu, a couple of Raspberry Pis as my own cloud storage and adblocking system - you get the idea. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything open source that makes life easier for people.
- 📫 How to reach me: email me here!
- 😄 Pronouns: They/them or he/him.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I lived in London for a long time.
